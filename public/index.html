				<h1>How to play</h1>
				<p>Card Fu is a simple strategy card game based on the Card-Jitsu minigame in Club Penguin. The rules are pretty simple, it's just a slightly more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors. In your hand you have five cards, each with an element, a power and a color. Each round you play a card and if you win the round, you gain the card you played as a point. Your card wins the round if it has the element that beats your opponent's card (water beats fire, fire beats ice, ice beats water) or, if you play the same type of element, if you have the higher power. To win the game, you have to collect a minimum of three points, where either all the elements and colors are unique, or where the elemts are the same, but the colors are unique.</p>
				<h3>Pro Tips!</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Know your enemy! The key to winning a game of Card Fu is knowing what your opponent is likely to play. Always keep an eye out for what type of card your opponent needs to win, or what strategy they are using.</li>
					<li>Counter counter plays! Before you play the perfect counter to your opponents winning move, take a moment to think about the fact that your opponent might very well expect you to do this, and have a play to counter your counterplay planned. They may even have foreseen your triple-counter!</li>
					<li>Don't overthink it! When you're sitting there, wondering whether your opponent is tripple-bluffing or even quadruple-bluffing, it might good idea to just choose the obvious play.</li>
